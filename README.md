# [WIP] PoolManager

This is yet another Work In Progress golang project in the category of low-key home automation.

The repo contains reusable, basic and pluggable components, such as:
* input (sensor) and output (actuator)
* a generic controller and scheduler to construct closed-loop automation
* a configuration store
* a generic, programmable webui for all above

The first real use of this project is a "swimming" pool temperature and pump control system, running on a Raspberry Pi.

More text to come (fingers crossed).
